# Human-Pose-Estimation
Implemented human activity detection model by using a combination of ConvLSTM cells. A ConvLSTM cell is a variant of an LSTM network that contains convolutions operations in the network. it is an LSTM with convolution embedded in the architecture, which makes it capable of identifying spatial features of the data while keeping into account the temporal relation.
